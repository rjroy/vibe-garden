Modernizing Software Development with AI
Agents: Lessons from History and HCI
Introduction
Software development is poised for a transformation akin to past technological revolutions. By examining
how other industries modernized – from the assembly line in manufacturing to mechanized agriculture –
we can draw insights into structuring “agentic” workflows in software projects. This report explores
historical analogies and human-centered (HCI) perspectives to propose agent role patterns for software
development teams. The aim is not to focus on technical implementation details, but to provide a research-
backed guide for defining AI agent roles and workflows in a development process. We present multiple
patterns: one inspired by industrial specialization (the “assembly line” of AI agents), and another
emphasizing complementary roles (balancing technical continuity with user-centric empathy). Throughout,
we weave academic insights with practical considerations, ensuring the ideas remain grounded in real-
world product development needs.

Lessons from Historical Modernization
Major leaps in productivity have often come from reorganizing work through new technology. Two
instructive examples are the introduction of the moving assembly line in early 20th-century manufacturing
and the adoption of the heavy plow in medieval agriculture. These cases illustrate how technology can
radically boost output while also necessitating new roles, cooperation, and attention to human factors.

The Assembly Line: Specialization and Efficiency

Workers on the moving assembly line at Ford’s Highland Park plant (1913) perform specialized tasks assembling
Model T components, exemplifying the new subdivided labor that drastically sped up production 1 2 . Henry
Ford’s implementation of the moving assembly line famously reduced car assembly time from over 12
hours to about 1.5 hours 1 . He achieved this by breaking the process into 84 discrete steps and training
each worker to master just one task, rather than having craftsmen build entire products 2 . The result was
unprecedented efficiency and consistency in output. Ford drew inspiration from continuous-flow
techniques in other industries (like meatpacking and flour milling) and applied scientific management (via
Frederick Taylor) to optimize each motion 2 . The “mass production” model that emerged made the
Model T affordable to the masses and was soon adopted across manufacturing. This specialization of labor
is directly analogous to how we might deploy multiple specialized AI agents, each focused on a narrow
aspect of software development, to dramatically increase productivity through parallelism and repeatable
processes.

However, the assembly line also highlighted human and organizational challenges. The work became
highly repetitive and regimented – so much so that early on Ford faced staggering employee turnover
(~370–380% annually) as workers quit the monotonous, speed-driven jobs 3 4 . Management responded
with an unprecedented solution: in 1914 Ford more than doubled worker pay to \$5 a day (while reducing

                                                     1
the workday to 8 hours from 9), as an incentive for employees to tolerate the “relentless discipline” of the
moving line 4 3 . This dramatic intervention paid off – thousands of job-seekers lined up for the
higher wages, turnover plummeted, and a stable workforce emerged to run the efficient system.

Crowds gather outside Ford’s Highland Park plant after the 1914 announcement of the \$5 workday, which
doubled wages to attract and retain workers for the demanding assembly line 4 . This underscores that
process innovations must account for human factors. The assembly line delivered productivity, but its
success depended on reimagining worker roles, incentives, and well-being. For product teams today, the
lesson is that introducing AI-driven processes will require addressing similar concerns – from ensuring
developers find the new workflow rewarding, to retraining people for higher-level tasks once routine work is
automated. Modern parallels might include maintaining developer motivation and trust when portions of
their work are offloaded to AI agents. Just as factories retained human oversight and adjusted working
conditions, software teams must consider user experience, team morale, and change management
when deploying “digital assembly lines.”

The Heavy Plow: Mechanization and Social Change

Long before assembly lines, another innovation – the heavy plow – transformed agriculture in medieval
Europe and offers insight into technological disruption. Introduced between the 8th and 11th centuries, the
heavy, wheeled plow with an iron plowshare and moldboard allowed farmers to finally till the thick, rich
soils of Northern Europe effectively 5 . Unlike the light scratch plows before, which required multiple
passes and intensive manual labor, the new plow cut deep furrows and turned the soil in one go. This
significantly increased crop yields and labor productivity by eliminating the need for cross-plowing and
reducing manual digging 6 . For example, deeper plowing brought fertile soil to the surface and improved
drainage; fields in parts of France eventually produced four times the yield previously common in
Charlemagne’s era 7 . Such gains led to surpluses, population growth, and economic expansion 8 6
– a genuine agricultural revolution.

Crucially, the heavy plow’s impact went beyond raw output. It reconfigured how work was organized and
how communities functioned. The new plow was costly and required teams of oxen or horses to pull, so
individual peasant farmers often had to cooperate, pooling animals or sharing equipment, to capitalize on
its power 9 . Strip fields grew longer to accommodate the plow’s straight furrows, altering land ownership
patterns and encouraging collective effort in villages 9 . In essence, technology forced a shift from
isolated labor to collaborative workflows. Social structures adapted: fewer people could cultivate larger
fields, freeing some labor for other tasks or trades, and medieval economies began shifting away from
subsistence farming 6 8 .

The heavy plow story highlights a few points relevant to software teams contemplating AI agents. First, a
powerful new tool can exponentially boost productivity, but to reap the benefits one must reorganize the
work system (just as farming practices, field layouts, and peasant agreements changed). Second,
cooperation and role differentiation became more important – those who provided animals, those who
operated the plow, those who managed surplus grain all had distinct roles. Similarly, introducing AI “agents”
into development might mean certain team members (or certain agents) take on highly specialized
functions, while others coordinate and integrate the results. Finally, the plow did not eliminate the farmer –
it augmented their capability. People still walked behind the plow to guide it, and they had to learn new
skills (like managing a team of draft animals). By analogy, developers will likely work alongside AI agents
rather than being replaced, taking on supervisory, integrative, or creative tasks that complement

                                                      2
automated productivity. History shows that the greatest gains come from humans and machines
working together, not from blindly replacing one with the other 10 . Each major innovation – be it plow or
assembly line – required both technical changes and human adaptation to succeed.

Industrializing Software Development with AI Agents
Today’s software development could be on the cusp of its own “industrial revolution” 11 . Projects are
growing in complexity, yet much of the work (coding, debugging, reviewing, testing) remains labor-
intensive. AI agents – autonomous software entities powered by advances in large language models – offer
a chance to automate the “repetitive, mind-numbing parts” of programming work and let human developers
focus on what they do best 11 12 . This vision explicitly mirrors the logic of industrialization: break down a
complex job into smaller tasks, automate the rote pieces, and streamline the flow of work so that overall
throughput increases even as quality remains high 11 . Crucially, the intent is not to replace developers end-
to-end, but to create a collaboration where AI handles the grunt work under human guidance – much like
specialized machines on an assembly line still require human oversight and involvement 10 .

In fact, analogies between software development and manufacturing are increasingly noted in industry. For
example, Sourcegraph refers to this shift as “industrialized software development,” arguing that by
automating repetitive tasks in code review, testing, maintenance, etc., developers will move faster, not slower,
as the codebase grows 11 12 . They have begun deploying AI coding agents targeted at specific functions:
Code Review Agents (to automatically review merge requests for errors or style issues), Testing Agents,
Documentation Agents, Code Migration Agents for updating legacy code, and so on 13 . Early reports are
promising – at companies like Indeed, an AI Code Review Agent is providing feedback on 1000+ pull
requests per week, catching bugs and quality issues, and saving hundreds of hours of human effort 14
 15 . This is essentially an assembly line approach: each agent is like a station on a production line,

handling its portion of the workflow (review, test, etc.) reliably and at scale.

Academic and experimental projects push this idea even further. The recently proposed ChatDev
framework envisions a “virtual software company” composed of multiple AI agents with distinct roles
collaborating to build software 16 . In one demonstration, ChatDev uses role-playing AI agents for the
three core phases of development – design, coding, and testing – each handled by different
specialized agents that communicate in natural language to coordinate their work 16 . Essentially, one
agent acts as the software designer or architect (figuring out requirements and high-level design), another
as the programmer (writing code), and a third as the tester (verifying and debugging) – passing along
information and code in a chain, much like an assembly line in a factory. Supporting roles like a project
manager or documentation writer can be added to the mix as well. A community-built implementation of
this idea depicted four departments: Design, Coding, Testing, and Documentation, each staffed by an AI agent
“employee” 17 . For instance, a CTO agent oversees technical decisions (ensuring the code is sound), a
Programming agent writes the code, a QA agent runs tests and checks everything works, and a
Documentation agent produces user manuals 18 19 . They communicate and even argue or correct each
other: the testing agent will kick failing code back to the coding agent with bug reports, and iterations
continue until the software passes tests 19 . Interestingly, studies find that having multiple agents interact
in this way can improve outcomes – the agents can “keep each other on track,” reducing errors and
combining their reasoning abilities to make better decisions 20 . In other words, a team of specialized AI
agents can exhibit emergent teamwork that a single giant AI might lack.

                                                       3
These developments suggest that one viable pattern for AI in software engineering is an assembly-line or
multi-agent pipeline, with specialized agents each owning a slice of the workflow. Just as in
manufacturing, this promises efficiency and consistency. But also echoing manufacturing, it introduces
challenges: how to orchestrate the agents, ensure they communicate effectively, and maintain overall
quality (to avoid, say, one agent generating flawed code that another agent fails to catch). Research like the
ChatDev project is actively exploring solutions, such as structured dialogues that force agents to clarify
requirements and verify each other’s outputs to mitigate hallucinations or mistakes 21 22 .

Equally important, a lesson from both the assembly line and these AI experiments is the continued need for
human insight and control. Factories did not run themselves – foremen, engineers, and workers remained
integral. Likewise, Sourcegraph emphasizes that AI agents should handle repetitive tasks but not replace
human developers 12 . Humans might serve as project leads or reviewers of last resort, focusing on
creative design, complex problem-solving, and ensuring the final product truly meets user needs
(something an AI might not fully grasp without guidance). In short, the path to modernizing software
development with AI is not a fully autonomous coding machine, but a human-plus-AI partnership. This
partnership can take different structural forms, which we explore next as patterns for agentic software
development workflows.

Pattern 1: Assembly-Line Multi-Agent Workflow
One pattern inspired directly by industrial modernization is the assembly-line model for software
development. In this approach, we imagine a sequence (or network) of specialized AI agents, each
responsible for a well-defined stage of the development lifecycle. Work products flow from one agent to the
next, with each agent adding its contribution or performing checks, much as a product on a conveyor belt
passes through stations for specific operations. This could also involve parallel lanes (for example, multiple
coding agents working on different modules simultaneously, feeding into a single integration agent), but
the core idea is role specialization and continuity.

In a concrete scenario, an assembly-line AI team might include agents in roles such as:

     • Requirements/Planning Agent: Interprets feature requests or specifications (possibly converting
       natural language user stories into technical tasks). It might clarify objectives, define acceptance
       criteria, and break down the project into units of work.
     • Design/Architecture Agent: Outlines the system architecture or UI/UX design. For instance, this
       agent could draft wireframes or choose architectural patterns, ensuring coherence in the overall
       design before coding starts.
     • Coding/Implementation Agent: Writes the code for each unit or feature. This agent would be akin
       to a production worker building a component – using a coding assistant model to generate
       functions, classes, etc., based on the design specs.
     • Code Review (Quality) Agent: Checks the code for errors, style compliance, potential bugs, or
       security issues. Sourcegraph’s Code Review Agent is an example in practice, automatically reviewing
       hundreds of commits for quality issues and providing feedback 15 .
     • Testing Agent: Executes test cases (unit tests, integration tests) and validates that the code meets
       requirements. It flags any failures or discrepancies. A Testing Agent might also generate additional
       test cases or perform fuzz testing to catch edge cases.
     • Integration & Continuity Agent: (Similar to the earlier concept of an “integration continuity agent.”)
       This agent’s role is to integrate all modules, manage build processes, and ensure that new code

                                                      4
       merges smoothly into the existing codebase without breaking anything. It would handle continuous
       integration (CI) tasks – compiling the project, deploying to a test environment, running regression
       test suites – effectively acting as a DevOps pipeline in agent form.
     • Documentation Agent: Generates documentation for end-users and developers. This could range
       from user manuals and API docs to release notes. In the ChatDev example, once coding and testing
       were done, the documentation agent wrote a user manual for the product automatically 23 .
     • Monitoring/Maintenance Agent: (Optional, for post-release.) Monitors the software in production
       for issues, analyzes user feedback or telemetry, and creates bug reports or improvement
       suggestions. It ensures the product continues to evolve after initial development.

These agents work in concert to complete a project from concept to delivery. For instance, the
Requirements Agent outputs a spec that the Design Agent uses to create a blueprint; the Coding Agent
implements it; the Testing Agent and Code Review Agent in parallel verify the implementation; the
Integration Agent regularly merges changes and keeps the build green; finally, the Documentation Agent
produces necessary guides. This pipeline can be iterative as well – if tests fail, the issue is sent back to the
Coding Agent to fix (just as ChatDev’s testing agent returned bugs to the coding agent 24 ). If a
requirement was misunderstood, the agents might escalate to a human product owner or loop back to the
Planning Agent for clarification.

Advantages: The assembly-line pattern offers efficiency through parallelism and expertise. Each agent
can be optimized (through model fine-tuning or tool use) for its specific task, potentially outperforming a
generalist approach. It also enforces a structured process, which can improve reliability: for example,
having a dedicated Testing Agent means no feature skips testing, analogous to quality control on a factory
line. In practice, we already see components of this: specialized bots for testing or CI, documentation
generators, etc., but an integrated multi-agent setup would coordinate them seamlessly. Sourcegraph’s
early results – like automated code maintenance that would have taken humans years – demonstrate the
huge productivity gains possible 14 .

Challenges: This approach requires careful orchestration. Just as an assembly line needs a factory floor
manager, a multi-agent system may need an orchestrator or supervisory mechanism to coordinate agents,
prevent deadlocks or gaps, and handle unexpected inputs. IBM’s crewAI framework, for example, focuses
on agentic orchestration, treating the group of agents as a “crew” that must work cohesively under some
central planning logic 25 . Another challenge is ensuring communication and knowledge flow among
agents. In human assembly lines, if one station finds a defect, it signals down the line or stops the belt – AI
agents need analogous signaling. Projects like ChatDev use a shared communication channel (a chat or
prompt chain) to let agents discuss and reason about the task, which was key to their success 22 . There’s
also the matter of quality assurance: if one agent in the chain fails (say, the testing agent has blind spots),
errors can slip through. Redundancy or overlap in responsibilities (e.g. both a code reviewer and a tester
agent checking the code) is one way to mitigate this, at the cost of some efficiency.

Human oversight remains vital in this pattern. Engineers or managers may fulfill a role akin to a product
line supervisor or systems engineer, monitoring agent outputs and stepping in to make judgment calls.
For instance, the planning agent might draft requirements, but a human product manager should verify
they align with true user needs before coding proceeds. This mix of automation and oversight aligns with
how industrial assembly lines still keep humans “in the loop” – virtually all factories employ humans on
the production line alongside machines for tasks requiring judgment or handling novel situations 10 .
Similarly, humans might handle creative design or complex debugging that stumps the agents.

                                                       5
In summary, the assembly-line multi-agent workflow pattern could vastly speed up software
development by leveraging division of labor among AI agents, much as the assembly line revolutionized
manufacturing. It plays to AI’s strengths in handling well-defined, repetitive tasks at scale. But it must be
implemented with robust coordination and a recognition of limits – we should be prepared to address the
“human factor” (e.g. developers trusting the process, defining clear handoffs, and maintaining a focus on
user value amid the automated hustle).

Pattern 2: Complementary Agent Pair – Tech Integrator vs. User
Empathizer
While the assembly-line model emphasizes breaking work into many narrow tasks, an alternative pattern
emerges when we incorporate insights from HCI and psychology: use a small team of agents with
complementary perspectives to tackle problems in a more holistic yet balanced way. In other words,
instead of a linear pipeline of specialists, we create an agent duo (or trio) that works in tandem on the
same task but from different angles. This approach is inspired by the recognition that successful
product development requires both technical excellence and user-centered thinking** – a combination of
“hard” and “soft” considerations that are sometimes at odds. By assigning these concerns to different
agents, we ensure neither is neglected.

A compelling instantiation of this idea is to have: (1) an Integration Continuity Agent and (2) a User
Empathy Agent – the two “things” that are distinct yet complementary in driving a project to completion.
Let’s define these roles:

     • Integration Continuity Agent: This agent’s mandate is maintaining technical integrity, feasibility,
       and continuity of the software project. It can be thought of as an AI project engineer or DevOps
       guardian. Its duties would include integrating new code with the existing system, ensuring builds/
       tests pass, managing version control and dependencies, and generally safeguarding that each
       change is consistent with the overall architecture. It also watches for continuity in development
       practices – making sure coding standards are followed and that the project’s technical roadmap
       stays on track. Essentially, this agent is technology-focused: it worries about performance,
       correctness, maintainability and the “backend” concerns. It might resemble a combination of a lead
       developer, a build manager, and a quality engineer in one role.

     • User Empathy Agent: This agent represents the voice of the end-user and the design perspective
       within the development process. Its role is to inject human-centered feedback at every stage. For
       example, the User Empathy Agent might take requirements or prototypes and simulate a user’s
       reaction – flagging if something seems confusing, non-intuitive, or misaligned with stated user
       needs. It could utilize HCI knowledge (usability heuristics, common user behaviors) to critique
       designs or even the wording in the UI. It might create or consult user personas and ensure the
       software addresses those personas’ pain points (a practice drawn from UX design 26 27 ). During
       development, if a feature is implemented that technically works, the empathy agent might say, “Yes,
       but from a user’s perspective this workflow is too complex – we should simplify it.” It effectively acts
       like an AI UX designer or product manager constantly asking, “Is this solving the right problem for
       the user in a good way?” This agent is user-focused: it cares about usability, satisfaction, and
       alignment with user expectations.

                                                      6
By pairing these two agents to work on the project simultaneously, we create a dynamic tension that can
lead to better outcomes. One ensures the solution is robust and integrated; the other ensures the solution
is desirable and easy-to-use. This mirrors the structure of many successful human teams, where you might
have an engineer and a designer (or a developer and a product owner) collaborating closely. In HCI
research and modern software practice, empathy and cross-functional collaboration are seen as keys to
success – developers are expected “to create experiences that connect with users on a personal level,” not just
churn out code 28 . However, developers can struggle with this due to personal bias or focus on technical
challenges 29 . A User Empathy Agent can fill that gap by constantly championing the user’s perspective,
since it is explicitly tasked to do so.

How the pair might work: Imagine the development of a new feature. The Integration Continuity Agent
begins drafting the technical implementation, choosing an approach that fits well with the codebase.
Simultaneously, the User Empathy Agent reviews the feature spec or prototype against user needs. If the
empathy agent detects a potential issue (“This design might confuse new users” or “This doesn’t address
the original user story effectively”), it would raise a concern. The two agents then enter a dialogue – the
empathy agent might propose a change to the workflow or UI text; the integration agent evaluates if that
change is technically feasible or if it might introduce complexity. They negotiate trade-offs: perhaps the
empathy agent convinces the integrator to adjust the feature for better UX, or the integrator explains
technical constraints that lead the empathy agent to suggest a different, more feasible improvement. This
interplay continues until they jointly produce a solution that is both technically sound and user-approved.
Once implementation is underway, the empathy agent could also simulate user testing on the output (e.g.,
using an internal language-based simulation of a user trying to perform a task) and report any pain points,
which the integration agent then fixes.

This pattern can be seen as a form of AI pair programming with divergent roles. Traditional pair
programming often has two developers alternate the driver/navigator roles; here we have one
“developer” (integration agent) and one “user advocate” (empathy agent) collaborating. It’s also reminiscent
of the concept of the “two pizza team” at Amazon or other small cross-functional teams, except in this case
each member is an AI with a distinct mindset. The diversity of perspective is deliberate – research in team
psychology shows that heterogeneous teams (mixing different expertise or viewpoints) can be more
innovative and catch more errors, at the cost of having to resolve more conflicts. In human-AI team studies,
trust and clear role definition are critical: the human needs to trust the AI’s suggestions and vice versa
  30 31 . In our AI-AI team, we similarly need the two agents to “trust” or at least respect each other’s

domain. That could be achieved by constraining each agent’s authority (e.g., the empathy agent cannot
directly change code but can make recommendations that the integrator agent must consider, and the
integrator agent cannot ignore user experience feedback beyond a certain point).

Benefits: The complementary agent pair ensures a well-rounded development process even with minimal
human input. It directly addresses a common failure mode in automation: focusing solely on either
technical metrics or user satisfaction, but not both. For example, an automated system might generate a
perfectly efficient piece of software that technically meets requirements but is awful for users – or
conversely, an AI might design a beautiful user interface that is technically unworkable. By having dedicated
agents for each concern, we deliberately force a balance. This pattern is also more flexible and creative
than a strict pipeline. The two agents brainstorming together can explore solutions in a less linear fashion
(more akin to a back-and-forth design process than a straight assembly line). This could lead to innovative
ideas – the empathy agent might suggest a feature tweak that a single-track pipeline would never consider.

                                                      7
It aligns with design thinking practices where you empathize, ideate, prototype, then test – here the
empathy agent handles the empathize/test, the integrator handles prototype/build, and they ideate jointly.

Another benefit is resilience to change. In dynamic projects, requirements evolve. A small, tight-knit set of
agents can adapt by continuous negotiation, whereas a long pipeline might be less agile if one stage has to
send work all the way back to the beginning. The empathy/integrator duo works more iteratively: each
small change is vetted in real-time by both perspectives.

Challenges: The complementary approach requires sophisticated dialogue and conflict-resolution between
agents. There is a risk they could deadlock (if user demands and technical constraints seem irreconcilable).
Setting up rules or a mediator (possibly a human or a higher-level “arbiter” agent) could be necessary for
arbitration. It’s also important to ensure the User Empathy Agent has access to real user data or
validated UX principles – otherwise it might make misguided suggestions. Feeding it with user research,
or even having it interface with actual users (through surveys or analyzing support tickets), could ground its
feedback in reality. Privacy and ethical design come into play here: the empathy agent might need to
champion accessibility or ethical considerations (like, “this feature might confuse elderly users” or “this dark
pattern might breach user trust”), acting as a check on purely growth- or profit-driven decisions. This is
analogous to having an ethicist or UX researcher in meetings; the AI agent could fill that role consistently.

From a human integration standpoint, developers might initially be skeptical of a “user empathy agent.”
Developers traditionally rely on UX designers or product managers for that input. If an AI starts giving UX
critique on their code or design, team members would need to learn to treat that critique seriously. It may
require building trust in the agent’s recommendations by demonstrating its understanding of user needs
(perhaps referencing known UX laws or past user feedback). Over time, if the empathy agent proves its
worth by preventing user issues, the team will value its role.

In summary, the complementary agent pair pattern leverages the power of diverse perspectives – a concept
from HCI and organizational psychology – within an AI-driven development process. It’s a less obvious
configuration than the assembly line, one we arrive at by thinking outside the traditional engineering
mindset and incorporating human-centric thinking and psychology. By having “Thing 1 and Thing 2” (in
this case, the integrator and the empathizer) work together, we inject both the efficiency of automation and
the wisdom of human-oriented design into the project. This pattern might not have emerged without
reviewing historic lessons (the need for cooperation and new roles) and HCI principles (the importance of
empathy and user focus). It demonstrates that modernizing software development isn’t only about speed,
but also about maintaining continuity of vision and empathy for the end-user throughout the
development journey.

Discussion: Choosing and Combining Patterns
The two patterns above are not mutually exclusive; in fact, they might be combined or applied at different
scales. For example, one could imagine a hybrid model where a pipeline of specialized agents is overseen by
a pair of complementary agents: the Integration Continuity Agent orchestrates the technical pipeline, while
the User Empathy Agent monitors the outputs at each stage for user-centric quality. This would resemble a
mini digital organization: multiple “workers” doing specific tasks, guided by a “technical lead” and a “user
advocate” ensuring both dimensions of quality are met. Such structures echo real-world agile teams that
include engineers, QA, UX, and product roles – only here some or all of those roles are fulfilled by AI agents.

                                                       8
It’s also worth noting that different projects may favor different configurations. A highly user-facing product
(like a mobile app) might benefit greatly from a User Empathy Agent’s involvement, whereas an internal
infrastructure project might lean more on technical automation agents in a pipeline. The maturity of the AI
models plays a role too: current AI may be more immediately reliable at tasks like code review or test
generation (which have clear correctness criteria) than at truly understanding nuanced human preferences.
That said, AI is rapidly improving at analyzing text feedback, sentiments, and usability patterns, so a User
Empathy Agent could utilize those capabilities (for instance, analyzing app reviews or support chats to
highlight frequent user pain points).

From a product development perspective, these research-driven patterns guide how we might define
agent roles and responsibilities in an AI-augmented development process. When planning an AI-assisted
project, one should ask: what “stations” would an assembly line for this project have? Where are the
repetitive tasks that an agent could automate? (e.g., testing, code compliance, refactoring – these map to
Pattern 1 roles.) And equally, what human-centric checks do we risk losing if we automate blindly? Where do
we need an agent to purposely think like a user or a human collaborator? (This yields Pattern 2 style roles to
incorporate.) By answering these questions, we can come up with a roster of AI agent roles tailored to the
project’s needs.

Conclusion and Next Steps
Historical revolutions in work – from the assembly lines of industrial factories to the heavy plows of
medieval fields – teach us that adopting new technology is not just a plug-and-play proposition. It requires
reimagining workflows, creating new roles, and balancing efficiency with human concerns. In software
development, AI agents hold the promise of automating tedious tasks and accelerating production,
effectively becoming our era’s “digital assembly line.” By studying how other industries managed
modernization, we anticipate that a successful integration of AI will involve clear division of labor among
agents, careful orchestration, and accommodations for the people in the loop (developers, users,
stakeholders) to ensure the transition boosts productivity and product quality.

We presented two patterns to spur creative thinking about agentic development flows:

     • Assembly-Line Multi-Agent Workflow: Many specialized agents (code, test, review, etc.) passing
       work down the line. This pattern maximizes raw efficiency and is already showing results in practice
       (e.g., automated code reviews and migrations). It draws directly from the success of subdivided labor
         2 , but it must be paired with coordination and human oversight to handle integration and novel

       issues, much as early assembly lines needed managers and process adjustments 3 .

     • Complementary Agent Pair (Integrator & Empathizer): A small team of agents with different
       priorities working concurrently. This pattern injects human-centric design and continuous
       integration together, ensuring that technical progress doesn’t outpace product usefulness or vice
       versa. It’s a novel construct that emerged from considering HCI principles of empathy and the
       importance of diverse perspectives in teams 28 26 . This pattern may sacrifice some specialization
       efficiency for the sake of holistic quality, which could be vital for creating software that truly
       satisfies users.

These patterns are not the only possibilities – indeed, further research and experimentation may unveil
other effective configurations (for example, larger multi-agent ecosystems or hierarchical agent

                                                      9
management structures). The patterns can also be scaled: one could have multiple complementary pairs
focusing on different features, or an assembly line where each “station” is itself a duo of agents checking
each other (imagine a coding agent paired with a review agent at one stage, a testing agent paired with an
empathy agent at another stage, etc.). The optimal solution likely depends on the context of development
and the specific strengths of available AI agents.

For product development teams looking to implement these ideas, the next steps would involve
prototyping and iteration. One could start with a limited scope – e.g., introduce a Testing Agent and
Documentation Agent (Pattern 1 elements) into the workflow and measure the impact, or set up an
Empathy Agent to shadow the team’s design discussions (Pattern 2 element) and see if it catches things the
team misses. User studies and internal feedback will be crucial: are the AI agents truly reducing workload?
Are they improving the end product’s quality from a user standpoint? Any failures or resistance (akin to the
Ford workers’ initial backlash) should be learned from and addressed – perhaps by refining the agent
prompts, improving the UI through which humans interact with agents, or re-scoping what tasks the agents
handle.

In conclusion, the convergence of historical insight, HCI psychology, and cutting-edge AI capabilities
provides a rich guide for defining AI agent roles in software projects. By not only automating but
thoughtfully re-architecting the development process with agents, we can achieve a step-change in
productivity comparable to past revolutions. Yet we are also reminded to remain grounded in human needs
– the ultimate measure of success is not lines of code produced per hour, but useful, reliable software that
serves people. The best outcome will likely come from AI agents and human developers working in concert,
each contributing what they excel at. As one industry expert succinctly put it, “History shows industrial
progress comes from humans and machines working together” 10 . Embracing that lesson, we can design our
new AI-driven workflows to amplify human creativity and empathy, not replace it, and thereby drive a truly
positive transformation in how we build software.
