## Categories

### 1. ü§î [Cognitive Planning Agents](./cognitive-planning-agents.md)
Agents focused on planning, decision-making, and cognitive functions.

*NOTES:* This could work as just a custom agent design. I've done this with just a prompt in a GPT before.

**Agents:**
- Modular Agentic Planner (MAP) - with 6 specialized modules
- Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Agent

**Key Use Cases:** Multi-step reasoning, complex planning, puzzle solving

---

### 2. ü§î [Memory Management Agents](./memory-management-agents.md)
Agents specialized in managing memory, context, and information persistence.

*NOTES:* This will require a custom MCP or even its own agent processor.

**Agents:**
- Cognitive Workspace Agent
- Memory Manager (CoALA Component)

**Key Use Cases:** Long-running conversations, context retention, knowledge synthesis

---

### 3. üëç [Self-Reflective Agents](./self-reflective-agents.md)
Agents that critique, evaluate, and improve their own outputs.

*NOTES:*
- This could easily be setup, but its still more than a simple agent prompt. Is this an agent SDK integration? LangChain?
- This is very similiar to what I did for the Task Loop.

**Agents:**
- Reflexion Agent
- Reflector Agent

**Key Use Cases:** Code generation, debugging, quality assurance, iterative refinement

---

### 4. üëç [Multi-Agent Collaboration Agents](./multi-agent-collaboration-agents.md)
Agents designed to work in teams with specialized roles.

*NOTES:* This is will require special orchestration.  Or at least a well defined manager agent.

**Agents:**
- Manager Agent
- Searcher Agent
- Analyst Agents (User/Item)
- Task Interpreter Agent
- Proponent Agent (Debate)
- Critic Agent (Debate)

**Key Use Cases:** Complex projects, orchestration, adversarial truth-seeking

---

### 5. ‚õî [Software Development Agents](./software-development-agents.md)
Agents specialized for software development lifecycle tasks.

*NOTES:* This is the current pattern and what I'm trying to avoid.  But its a good reference. There is still likely bits of it that are of interest. And I can see a future where a hybrid approach is used.

**Agents:**
- Requirements/Planning Agent
- Design/Architecture Agent
- Coding/Implementation Agent
- Code Review Agent
- Testing Agent
- Integration & Continuity Agent
- Documentation Agent
- Monitoring/Maintenance Agent
- User Empathy Agent

**Key Use Cases:** Full software development lifecycle, from planning to maintenance

---

### 6. üëé [Neural-Symbolic Integration Agents](./neural-symbolic-agents.md)
Agents combining neural networks with symbolic reasoning.

*NOTES:* This is a very interesting area.  But its not something I can implement right now due to how entangled with the LLM it is.  Worth keeping an eye on.

**Agents:**
- LLM-ACTR Agent
- World Model Agent
- Epistemic Delegation Agents

**Key Use Cases:** Explainable AI, complex decision-making, precise reasoning

---

## Takeaways

### üëç What we can/should do now:
- [Self-Reflective Agents](./self-reflective-agents.md)
- [Multi-Agent Collaboration Agents](./multi-agent-collaboration-agents.md)

Both are relatively straightforward to implement with existing tools and frameworks. They offer immediate benefits in quality assurance and complex task management.

### ü§î What we can explore for future development:
- [Cognitive Planning Agents](./cognitive-planning-agents.md)
- [Memory Management Agents](./memory-management-agents.md)

These require more sophisticated design and integration but hold promise for enhancing reasoning and context handling.

### üëé What to monitor for long-term innovation:
- [Neural-Symbolic Integration Agents](./neural-symbolic-agents.md)

This area is still emerging and may need significant advancements in both AI research and tooling before practical application.

### ‚õî What we are trying to avoid:
-[Software Development Agents](./software-development-agents.md)

These are too closely tied to current job roles and may not generalize well. They also risk becoming overly complex and rigid.

## Design Principles Across All Agents

1. **Specialization** - Each agent has clear, focused responsibility
2. **Modularity** - Agents can be combined and reconfigured
3. **Communication** - Agents exchange information via structured protocols
4. **Feedback Loops** - Many agents incorporate self-improvement mechanisms
5. **Complementarity** - Different agents cover different aspects (technical vs user-centric)
6. **Human Oversight** - All systems assume human-in-the-loop for critical decisions

## Real-World Impact Examples

**Sourcegraph (Indeed):** Code Review Agent processes 1000+ PRs weekly, saving hundreds of hours

**ChatDev Research:** Multi-agent system with Designer, Coder, Tester agents successfully built software autonomously

**MAP Architecture:** Achieved significantly better planning with fewer hallucinations than monolithic LLM

**Reflexion:** +11% accuracy improvement on code generation tasks (91% vs 80%)

**Cognitive Workspace:** 58% memory reuse vs 0% in passive systems, 17% efficiency gains

## Evolution & Future Directions

The agent landscape is rapidly evolving from:
- **Single monolithic LLMs** ‚Üí **Specialized modular agents**
- **Human job title analogies** ‚Üí **Computational function abstractions**
- **One-shot responses** ‚Üí **Iterative feedback loops**
- **Passive retrieval** ‚Üí **Active memory management**
- **Pure neural** ‚Üí **Neural-symbolic integration**
