Agent A: "Thanks, incorporating into recommendation"
```

### Structured Messages
```json
{
  "from": "PlannerAgent",
  "to": "CoderAgent",
  "type": "task_assignment",
  "content": {
    "task": "implement_function",
    "spec": "...",
    "deadline": "..."
  }
}
```

### Shared Workspace
```
Agents read/write to common blackboard
Each agent posts updates
Pattern-matching triggers agent responses
Coordination emerges from shared state
```

---

## Collaboration Modes

### Cooperative (Additive)
All agents work toward common goal.
```
Research Agent → Gathers information
Analysis Agent → Processes data
Report Agent  → Synthesizes findings

Result: Comprehensive report
```

### Complementary (Diverse Perspectives)
Agents represent different viewpoints.
```
Technical Agent → Feasibility analysis
UX Agent → User impact analysis
Business Agent → ROI analysis

Result: Balanced decision
```

### Adversarial (Competitive)
Agents compete to surface best solution.
```
Proponent → Defends solution A
Critic → Challenges solution A
Judge → Decides winner

Result: Vetted solution
```

### Iterative (Refinement)
Agents pass work back and forth.
```
Coder → Writes code
Reviewer → Finds issues
Coder → Fixes issues
Tester → Validates

Result: Refined code
```

## Real-World Example: MACRec

**Source:** Wang et al., 2024 (Emerging-Theory-for-Agents.md)

**Multi-Agent Framework for Recommendations**

### Team Composition:
- **Manager** - Plans strategy, assigns subtasks
- **User Analyst** - Understands user profiles
- **Item Analyst** - Understands item characteristics
- **Searcher** - Queries external knowledge
- **Reflector** - Checks for errors/inconsistencies

### Workflow:
1. Manager receives recommendation request
2. Assigns analysis to User & Item Analysts
3. Searcher gathers additional context
4. Analysts report findings to Manager
5. Reflector checks for contradictions
6. Manager synthesizes recommendation
7. Team iterates if issues found

### Results:
- Outperformed single-agent approaches
- Especially effective on complex, nuanced tasks
- Reflector caught errors in real-time
- Long reasoning chains handled better

---

## Key Characteristics

### Advantages:
- **Specialization** - Each agent optimized for its role
- **Reliability** - Cross-verification catches errors
- **Scalability** - Easy to add more specialists
- **Robustness** - System continues if one agent struggles
- **Flexibility** - Agents can be reconfigured for different tasks
- **Emergent Intelligence** - Team capabilities exceed individual agents

### Challenges:

---

## Coordination Mechanisms

### Hierarchical
```
Top Agent (Manager)
  ├─ Middle Agents (Team Leads)
  │   ├─ Worker Agent 1
  │   ├─ Worker Agent 2
  │   └─ Worker Agent 3
  └─ ...

Commands flow down, reports flow up
```

### Peer-to-Peer
```
Agent A ↔ Agent B
  ↕         ↕
Agent C ↔ Agent D

All agents communicate directly
Emergent coordination
```

### Market-Based
```
Task posted to "market"
Agents "bid" on tasks based on capability
Best-suited agent wins task
Efficient resource allocation
```

### Protocol-Based
```
Formal communication protocols
Standardized message formats
Turn-taking rules
Deadlock prevention mechanisms
```

---

## Design Patterns

### 1. Hub-and-Spoke
Central coordinator, specialist agents around periphery.
```
Good for: Clear task decomposition
Bad for: High coordinator load
```

### 2. Pipeline
Agents arranged in sequence.
```
Good for: Sequential workflows
Bad for: Inflexible, bottlenecks
```

### 3. Network
Agents form flexible communication network.
```
Good for: Dynamic collaboration
Bad for: Coordination complexity
```

### 4. Hierarchical Teams
Agents organized in management hierarchy.
```
Good for: Large-scale organization
Bad for: Communication delays
```

---

## Communication Challenges & Solutions

If mismatch: Investigate or vote
```

### Majority Voting
```
Multiple agents solve same problem
Take consensus answer
Outliers flagged for review
```

### Hierarchical Review
```
Worker agents complete tasks
Supervisor agent reviews
Manager agent final approval
```

### Reflector Pattern
```
Dedicated reflector agent
Monitors all agent interactions
Flags inconsistencies
Provides meta-level oversight
```

---

## When to Use This Pattern

## Key Insights

### From Research:

> "Studies find that having multiple agents interact in this way can improve outcomes – the agents can 'keep each other on track,' reducing errors and combining their reasoning abilities to make better decisions."

> "Multi-agent theoretical models emphasize role abstraction at the system level: instead of one giant black-box model, we have a constellation of agents each excelling at a particular function."

### Core Themes:
- **Collective Intelligence** - Team > sum of individuals
- **Epistemic Exploration** - One agent focuses on information gathering
- **Deviation Detection** - Dedicated checker agent
- **Self-Correction** - One agent's output is another's input
- **Controllable Scaling** - Carefully designed interactions

## Future Directions

- **Formalized Interactions** - Communication protocols, trust boundaries
- **Learning Dynamics** - Teams that improve together
- **Adaptive Teams** - Agents join/leave based on task needs
- **Human-AI Teams** - Seamless collaboration with humans
