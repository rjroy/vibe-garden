# Cognitive Planning Agents

## Overview
Agents focused on planning, decision-making, and cognitive functions inspired by human cognition.

## Modular Agentic Planner (MAP)

**Source:** Emerging-Theory-for-Agents.md (Webb et al., 2025)

**Description:** Brain-inspired modular architecture that decomposes planning into specialized LLM modules modeled after prefrontal cortex functions.

**Key Components:**
- Error/Conflict Monitor - Catches infeasible actions and prevents invalid steps
- State Predictor - Predicts future states
- State Evaluator - Evaluates states for goal alignment
- Task Decomposer - Breaks down complex tasks into subtasks
- Action Proposer - Suggests possible actions
- Coordination Module - Integrates all modules for goal-directed planning

**Strengths:**
- Reduced hallucinations and invalid steps
- Avoids getting stuck in loops during planning
- Better performance on multi-step reasoning benchmarks (graph traversal, Tower of Hanoi)
- Transferable across tasks
- Effective even with smaller language models

**Use Cases:**
- Multi-step reasoning tasks
- Complex planning problems
- Graph traversal
- Puzzle solving

**Key Insight:** By assigning each cognitive function to an LLM-based "expert" and having them interact, MAP yields substantially improved performance compared to monolithic LLM agents.

## Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) Agent

**Source:** Emerging-Theory-for-Agents.md (Yao et al., 2023)

**Description:** Deliberative search agent that explores branching trees of possible thoughts/solutions, using LLM self-evaluation to decide which branches to expand or prune.

**Key Features:**
- Branches out at decision points creating tree of possible states
- Uses heuristic evaluations generated by LLM as reflective judgments
- Can backtrack if reasoning leads to dead end
- Dynamic plan adjustment
- Built-in deviation check via heuristic scoring

**Strengths:**
- State-of-the-art performance on complex puzzles
- Superior to greedy one-shot LLM reasoning
- Effective for tasks requiring strategic planning
- Enables lookahead and global search

**Use Cases:**
- Complex puzzles
- Math word problems
- Crosswords with interconnected answers
- Any task requiring exploration of solution space

**Key Insight:** Reintroduces classical AI search algorithms (Newell and Simon's heuristic search) into LLM context, combining semantic knowledge with systematic exploration.
